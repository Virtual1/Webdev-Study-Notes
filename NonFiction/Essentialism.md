## Choose
* Choose what makes us human
* "I choose to," not "I have to"
* Exercises the power of choice, doesn't forfeit it

## Discern
* Most of what exists has little value with little result; but few things work great with good impact
* Almost everything is nonessential
* Distinguishes the vital few from the trivial many. Not all opportunities are equal.

## Trade-Off
* Making choices and trade-offs - deliberately choosing to be better
* Accept the reality of trade-offs
* Considers the trade-off they'll be making. Can't ever have both
* Goes big on what's important, doesn't try to do it all

## Escape
* "Without great solitude, no serious work is possible"
* Create space to escape and explore life. Make time to think about life
* Need to escape in order to have focus

## Look
* Where's the knowledge we've lost in the info?
* Find the signal in the noise, not just the loudest voices
* Hear what's not being said. Don't need to worry about everything being said
* Scans for the essence of information. Don't get overwhelmed by it all

## Play
* Occasional nonsense is important
* Play is essential, not trivial
* Play sparks exploration, which helps productivity in the long run

## Sleep
* Protecting the asset of our bodies
* One hour of sleep is several productive hours, and is high priority
* Breeds creativity
* Gives the highest level of mental contribution
* Helps us prioritize

## Select
* "Inward process stands in need of outward criteria"
* Only say yes to the top 10% of opportunities, not all of them
* Narrow, explicit criteria based on what exactly one's looking for
* If not a clear "yes", then it's a clear "no"
* Meets three of three minimum criteria, and two of the three ideal (more extreme) criteria

## Clarify
* Strategy that's both concrete and inspirational
* Strategy is meaningful and memorable
* One decision that's specific enough to eliminate 1,000 another decisions. Great clarity of direction and what's needed
* Not vague such as "better Internet," but specific such as "available, high-performing Internet for the entire country"

## Dare
* Is able to say "no" firmly, resolutely, and gracefully
* Only say "yes" to things that really matter

## Uncommit
* Don't be afraid to cut your losses
* "If I weren't already invested in this, how much would I invest now?" Don't fall for the sunk cost fallacy
* "What else could I do with this time and money if I pulled the plug now?"
* Comfortable with cutting losses
* Avoiding casual commitments
* Get over the Fear of Missing Out

## Edit
* Making things better sometimes means subtracting them
* Eliminates distracting words, images, and details
* Condense and correct

## Limit
* Limits help you become limitless in the established areas
* Boundaries are liberating
* Setting rules in advance eliminates the need for a direct "no" as an answer
* Find your deal-breakers, which lead to an automatic "no"

## Buffer
* Builds in the buffer for unexpected events
* Practices extreme and early preparation

## Subtract
* Add things every day for knowledge. Subtract things every day for wisdom
* Removes obstacles in order to process, not just quick-fix solutions
* Brings more out of less

## Progress
* Focus on incremental progress
* Start small, get big results. Don't just focus on a big goal
* Celebrates small acts of progress

## Flow
* Make habits out of what's essential, so they're done automatically
* Essential is the default

## Focus
* Focus the mind on the present, not the past and future
* Tune in to what's important right now, not tomorrow or yesterday
* Enjoy the moment
