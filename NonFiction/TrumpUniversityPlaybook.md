# Sleazy Salesmanship Tips and Tricks to Watch Out For

### Assumptive Language

A major theme in many of the playbook is what I call "assumptive language." Several paragraphs end with the importance of being _short, simple, and assumptive._

Assumptive language basically has built in suppositions that aren't directly said by the seller, but are built into something else they say. Similar to notes from _The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense,_ the trick is to build assumption X into a statement but get the buyer to focus on responding to statement Y, which is the "bait". Responding to statement Y makes the seller "swallow" assumption X, and makes them more likely to act as though they agreed with it.

An example from this playbook is _"What type of credit card will you be using today?"_ The question makes the seller focus on **choosing a credit card**, but the assumption built into this is **they're already paying.** Therefore by answering the "bait" of the type of credit card, they're passively accepting they're going to pay! So it's important to spot and directly address any assumptions in statements like this, and not take the bait.

This is important since it subconsciously nudges and pushes sellers into believing they've already decided to buy. Thankfully you can avoid this by simply being aware of it, and calling out the assumptions when you spot them.

The playbook has lots of examples of assumptive language for the sellers:

* It's better to say "Congratulations" instead of "Thank You," since the buyer ends up thanking the seller. This keeps the balance of power tipped in the seller's favor - the buyer is showing gratitude, and therefore deference, to the seller.
* Lines like **"You look like you're ready to get started..."** or **"I can tell you're thinking about getting enrolled, what can I help you with?"** have assumptions that the seller will enroll.
* During the preliminary lessons, sellers talk to buyers with assumptions that they're going to enroll in the full course, such as "When you're in the full course."
* Sellers will say "I noticed" and follow it up with something specific, like when they took notes on what the speaker said. This has a presumption that the buyer stood out from the crowd, which lets the buyer indirectly flatter the seller, so they're more receptive without it seeming insincere.

> The words “I noticed” [...] send a subliminal message to them that they stood out in the crowd, that they are attractive or charismatic or that they impressed you. People love recognition and attention.

### Controlling the Conversations

Sellers will employ many tricks to control the conversation and flow of the event. They already have a natural advantage here since they're organizing the event itself, and are in a position of "organizers" controlling the flow of things.

> We are the leaders. We decide what the training will be like. Customers are responding to us. We have control.

> They have turned casual conversation into an art, persuading by subtle inference and influence rather than more overt presentation and persuasive talk.

The playbook mentions many other tricks to reinforce this.

* Sellers will limit the number of questions you ask. At most they'll let you ask one, and then find one way to keep you from asking more or put them off. Whoever asks questions is in the position of power, since the person answering is just responding to them. This makes it easier for sellers to steer the buyers into purchasing, slanting their decision-making process.
* The playbook gives many common rebuttals to excuses or questions. Virtually _all_ of them end with a powerful rebuke of whatever the person said, and lots of presumptive language about them signing up. This helps shut down further questions or conversation.

> Remember that we have time to think and plan and develop questions and commands that lead people into a flow that they must deal with and respond to. Without a game plan you are required to respond to them and do much more thinking on your feet. Remember that we need to stay on “offense.”

* Early buyers won't be told they're still setting up, since that tells them the organizers aren't in total control of what's happening. The sellers get around this by telling the early arrivals to wait in the registration area until other buyers arrive, keeping them away without admitting a lack of control.
* Controlling the conversation makes it easier for sellers to discover your problems, or "pain points." The more they know about your problems, they more they can use it against you to make it hurt and sell their services as a solution. They'll aim to find at least three problems, since you're most likely to seek a solution.

> Problems are like health. The more a problem hurts now, the more the need for a solution now. And the more it hurts, the more they'll be prepared to pay for a speedy solution. **It's got to hurt enough!**

### Cheap Tricks

* Preferred tone is repeatedly passionate, friendly, and intense. It's simply to make someone look friendly and approachable, but also to get them curious about what you sell. The basic thought process goes "they have so much passion from this, and I want to feel that too along with the other benefits."
* The playbook references the below words as the most persuasive in the English language. Watch if someone repeatedly says them to you.

> The most persuasive words in the English language according to a study by the Psychology Department of Yale University are: **You, New, Money, Easy, Discovery, Free, Results, Health, Save, Proven, Guarantee, and Love.** They share three characteristics: they are simple, familiar and dramatic.

* Sellers will try to make buyers sit, since they're more likely to buy. It makes paperwork and waiting more comfortable, and a more relaxed mindset means more willing to buy. It's easier to walk away when standing.
* Sellers will stand in front of registration desks and tables to appear more approachable.
* Sellers will appeal to your emotions more than anything. Despite the logic involved, the root of the decision is always emotional. Sellers know and focus on this.

> ...there may be much logical processing, but the point of decision is always emotional, and usually subconscious.

* Sellers will never act impressed, since it may make the buyer think they don't need what they're selling. They will say buyers have the right mindset and are in the right place to learn more, which are positive ways to subtly remind the buyer they won't really learn unless they buy.
* Sellers are trained to monitor all telltale body language signs, including all signs of positive or negative response. They use this to build their specific knowledge of you and better find out what buttons to press to get you to buy. Always assume they'll notice little things like widening eyes or tilting your head away.
