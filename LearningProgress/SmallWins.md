* Added some notes to [Ember components](./../JavaScript/Ember/Components.md#component-extending) on how to extend them, keeping functionality drier.
* You can open Visual Studio Code from the command line! [Set it up here.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac) But if there's common files and folders you keep opening and editing, this makes accessing them real easy.
* I haven't emphasized the small wins enough. Hence I started this file to keep a record of my small wins and a visual marker of how much progress I'm making. Visual feedback is a great motivater.

* Starting checking out front-end testing frameworks, both integration and visual regression. Looks like TestCafe and BackstopJS are the most approachable (and free) ones to start with.
* Tested out how you can make saved commands with arguments in Bash - using a function! It can be in the aliases file, or in a separate shell file (which you can reference in alias). [Check it here](./../Programming/bash.md). I also added more general Bash notes.
