Two main terms in populist narrative:

* **The people:** ordinary virtues (hard working, honest, etc), government is meant to empower the people
* **The elites:** Parasitic and pray upon the people by exploiting or oppressing them. Act against their interests. Crave power and wealth, will lie/cheat/steal/cross fingers behind back to get it.
Told in many different ways over the course of history - Occupy Wall Street, Tea Party, other activist groups, where telling this story has been important. Steers people towards certain political actions, such as purchasing over-priced books filled with flowery languages. Sold as how it will be affecting your kids future.
* NOTE: If teacher is wrong, demand a refund from the chancellor. Quote the professor on this if necessary.
* Familiar “elite” groups: The Illuminati, the Masons, communists, Jews, assuming black people as well. Been scapegoated and stigmatized, blamed for praying off the peoples’ good intentions.

Then steps from populism ideas to scapegoating ideas

* Will claim to offer a series of clues and tracks, like breadcrumbs, that show proof of elites being evil. Dollar bill is commonly used for this, consistent source of face-palming by people who have functioning frontal lobes.
* Punchline: tell people who to blame and attack them, prevent them from doing harm, stop them from having children, vaporize them, etc. Not funny despite being referred to as a “punchline."
* Freakish ones: evildoers are seen as the source of all of the evil, and are the only sources of evil. If they can be eliminated since they’re the root of all evil, everything will be beautiful and what not. Often based in religious belief instead of reason (dismiss counter evidence as part of a conspiracy), not surprising since religious belief has made people act irrational or in insane ways in the past.
* Conspiracies are often layered on top of each other, like saying communists are suddenly pawns of the Illuminati. They will then be under the control of evil brain slugs, who will simply be pawns of liberals in the IRS. More complex to keep people entertained and outraged.

Conspiracy culture has grown since the end of WWI due to rising involvement in global politics. As national security state based in secrecy and misleading the public, people became more distrusting of government.

**Demagogue:** charismatic liar who claims to speak for the people while encouraging actions that go against them. Makes the topic ultimately about him instead of the people with intense manipulation. See: Ted Cruz, Dr. Oz, all members of the U.S. Senate, and Chancellor Syverud. 

QUESTION: Does the NRA count as a populist conspiracy culture, or at least fueling one? Mainly with referring to anyone in the White House or on Meet the Press as an out-of-touch elite.

Notes from first reading (Populist Persuasion, pg. 1-46)

* Populist language first used by the left for progressive, union and worker focused causes. But was later used more effectively by the right around the time of Goldwater for the reverse, actually working against the masses’ interests. 
* Populism is more of a rhetoric tool than an ideology. Can be used in different contexts and ways for different projects. This explains why all idiots in politics use populist language, instead of the especially deceptive ones.
* Populism was used prominently for the first few centuries of American history and by many presidents (Eisenhower, Lincoln, etc), but several factors limited its effectiveness. One that caught my interest was that “populism” was interpreted mainly as represented land-owning, educated men. Women and blacks were excluded and had too tough a time getting integrated into the movement.

* **Americanism:** America as an idea or ideal, individual freedom. Achievement is possible, the people and the system are fundamentally good- leads to optimism. Being patriotic and nationalistic, an ideal of exceptionalism, idea that the people rule (we’ve escaped the old-world monarchy and aristocracy that’s born into excessive power). Elites don’t rule, it’s ordinary Americans. Bonus points for wearing starts and stripe-patterned boxers. It is a Republic - government serves the people, so the people are sovereign and not the gov (people only give gov some of its power for its job, popular sovereignty). 
* **The People:** ordinary people, who work for a living and are the producers (of essential goods). Can lead to an ideology of producerism. Pandered to by saying “hard-working Americans,” “the middle class,” etc. Neither rich nor poor. Represent the population’s majority, practical, inventors, doers not thinkers, have common sense. God-fearing, virtuous, moral. During the country’s founding, women and blacks were seen as dependent or incapable of being independent producers, so were implicitly/explicitly excluded and discriminated against.
* **The Elites:** Over-educated, book-smart, out-of-touch pinheads. Impose their few values on the many people, though their values aren’t based on common-sense and virtue of the people - seen as defying common sense, scornful of ordinary people. Self-interested plutocrats manipulating system (corrupt, deceptive, possibly secular, hedonistic, relativistic, have never enjoyed BBQ sauce) for their benefit at the expense of the many. Parasitic and depend on the labor of the people. Are highly-paid wolves in sheep’s clothing, who aren’t self-made men and have inherited their wealth. Indulgent in their wealth, status, consumerism, etc.
* **Popular movement to restore Americanism:** Bring back power from the elites to the people by mobilizing the power of the masses, disempower elites and repower the people. Prohibit immoral acts. Redress the balance of society’s power. Meant to act as a cycle instead of something to take radical action. Not about full-scale revolution, but about taking out the elites from an otherwise strong, moral state so America can go back to how it’s supposed to be.

Right-wing Populism Notes:

* All the tenets of right-wing populism are in the conservative campaign against Jonathan Gruber and his remarks on the ACA.
* Liberal populism: changing social institutions. Conservative populism: reinforcing social hierarchies.

##### Omaha Platform:

* Populist Party officially launched in 1892, was the first official populist platform. Statement that launched the people’s party.
* Fueled by enormous inequality, many with great wealth while many more were struggling to make ends meet.
* Focused on skilled laborers like craftsmen, farmers, etc. The elites were bankers, capitalists, “robber barons.” Perceived them as having a plutocratic stranglehold, with either hands or a noose.
* Aimed to expand the money supply (lessen value of debts), nationalize the railroads to corporations profit less, strengthen union powers and stop private police from busting them. Use the power of government for these goals and offset the power of private interests.
* Redeem America’s promise through this rebalance of power

##### Father Coughlin
* The “Rush Limbaugh” of his time, minus the extra layers of walrus fat (likely)
* Rose to prominence in the 1930s, extreme unemployment and bad economy. Led to a rise in radical parties like communism and socialism.
* Rose with the growing important of broadcast media and radio to a broad audience. Could be called a demagogue.
* America seen as a WASP country - White Anglo Saxon Protestant. Catholics were beginning to get integrated and persecuted against less (though still plenty of tension).
* Coughlin said there was a great need for social justice to help up people and prevent them from falling under communist influence. Based on roots of Catholic teaching. Sliding of populist rhetoric into conspiracy of evil commies.
* Said lack of social justice was due to modern capitalism, which was due to Jews as financial elites and bankers using modern capitalism. This was the conspiracy theory area he slid into as part of his downfall(?)
* Group was also anti-catholic
* Manipulated money sent to him, such as personal donations, and pulled a good income
* Eventually led to the creation of the National Union for Social Justice (NUSJ). However, his presidential candidacy for public office failed due to a lack of votes.

**Progressive forms of populism** - Look at examples of exploitation and dominance in society, and then ask:

* How is this possible?
* What kinds of social institutions of structures make this social inequality possible? How to reform them?
* Examples: Popular Front, New Deal - fundamentally reshaped American institution
* Solution: passing new laws and furthering social movements

**Regressive forms of populism** - Focus more on blaming and scapegoating, assume that US institutions are close to flawless (Christianity + Constitution kicks ass, etc), BUT there’s somebody screwing it up!

* Who are the anti-American evildoers?
* How do we neutralize them?
* Solution: attack individuals or lawmakers responsible
* Examples: Father Coughlin
    * evil people were anti-Catholic
    * regularly capitalism is great but "modern capitalism” was bad - dominated by finance and wall street
    * The ultimate enemies were international bankers + Jews

### How Conservatives could organize a populist movement
* **Key terms:** Popular Front, New Deal, Industrial Labor Movement, third essay question
* Started with high unemployment in the Great Depression, questioned capitalism of the 1920s
* FDR - we need to save capitalism from itself, need experimental measures to do so. Hence, the New Deal, new measures to help people.
    * Social Security - take care of old people
    * Banking reform and insurance (up to 250k) - insure deposits to stop runs on the bank
    * Unemployment insurance - money while finding a new job
    * Food stamps - part of relief for basic needs
    * Civilian Conservation Corps - gov employed people to build infrastructure, also other positions
    * New meaning of liberalism - guaranteed rights and basic securities (freedom from want)
    * National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) - law that workers have a right to unionize and collectively bargain, employers can’t disrupt this. Created National Labor Relations Board to protect this.
* The rise of the New Deal and more activist government was also a huge grassroots response and populistic ideas against industrial monopolies and elites. There was a fear of social revolution in America, New Deal measures meant to prevent a more radical movement from arising while still saving capitalism. Supposed to soothe and respond to these populist feelings
    * Economic reason: people needed enough money to buy the actual products of industry, otherwise it’d be a downward spiral of lack of demand and unemployment. Put money back in people’s pockets and keep the economy moving, spun as being in everyone’s best interests. Reversed idea of “consumers as parasites.” Create an “American Standard of Living,” meet basic needs and have disposable income.
    * CIO (Congress of Industrial Organizations) become a leader in the industrial union movement, aimed to create a union for every major industry.
    * Also a pluralistic element to this - willing to accept all backgrounds and beliefs, since they’d need all to succeed. Also to keep people from competing for lower wages, which is why “solidarity” was an important idea in the movement (hurt one, hurt us all).
        * Rest of society was still racially segregated, so there was still racism in many union areas despite attempts to overcome it. Also still no idea of women earning a living wage, men still “breadwinners.” The regressive side of an otherwise progressive movement, ambivalence to race and gender.
* Communism also flourished in Great Depression, since it seemed capitalism was failing. Involved in, and influential in, the industrial movement and promote racial equality. Not perfect, since it was authoritarian and often getting orders from Moscow. Still a significant progressive force during the Union movement.
    * Communists adapted ideology of the “Popular Front” - drop the “with us or against us” attitude and allied with other Democratic voices to resist Fascism. Mobilized around common ideals, like industrial unionism, where they could at least agree on some version of these ideas to get together behind.
    * Great Depression greatly helped the communist party from the 1930s to the 1940s.
        * Was during the rise of Fascism
        * Unemployment rose and industrialization seemed shaky

* During world war II, unions were asked by governments to not strike. In return, they’d officially recognize and protect all these unions. Relationship between the two were even stronger.
* Later on, however, the economy began to slowly falter from its highs post WWII. In the 1940s onwards, conservatives began populist rhetoric of “getting big government off our backs,” continually got worse. Culminating in the Reagan administration’s platform.
    * After WWII, business leaders hated needing to work with unions.
    * Southern segregationist democrats also hated the New Deal’s moving towards progressive integration
    * Also hated by Republicans since Democrats kept winning elections, wanted to get back into power.

Right-wing populist narrative originating from the Red Scare/WWII: 

* There are Americans, usually liberals, that are plotting to overthrow America and destroy our freedom bunnies. Plus there’s many people, all basically liberals, who are vulnerable to corruption and will join the fight to kill that’s free.

### The Original Red Scare

* Even before the official Cold War started after WWII, these feelings originated towards the Soviets during the actual conflict. As undercover threats and alien ideologies that are fundamentally un-American and would plunge the country into anarchy.
    * This was during WWI, after Russians withdrew from the war and the Soviet Union was established. US was one of many nations that send troops + aid to anti-Bolshevik forces (the White Russians in Russia).
    * US refused to recognize the USSR as people in charge and deal with them as gov (from 1920 to 1933).
* There was a first red scare after WWI, Attn. Gen. Palmer and FBI Red Hunter launched raids against suspected Leftists
    * anarchists, socialists, communists, labor militants, all rounded up
    * WWI espionage and sedition laws used to make it a crime to criticize gov policy, seen as disloyal traitors or foreign agents, to suppress speech
    * Thousands arrest and held without trial, 600 forcibly deported
* Red Scare + Palmer raids supported by:
    * anti-labor businessmen
    * Anti-immigrant nativists + Southern segregationists
    * American vets and patriotic groups
* In 1930-40s, these groups are all still there and directed the energy towards Roosevelt + the New Deal in the Post WWII scare.

##### 1930s - Communism and the Popular Front

* Mass suffering after the Great Depression de-legitimzed capitalism, many then saw the planned + gaining economy in the USSR as a new model for fostering progress and meeting the pop’s needs.
* Also rise of fascism in Europe (Franco in Spain, Mussolini in Italy, Hitler in Germany) also major threats to democratic values, people wanted to battle the fascists
* Communist Party then embodies the Popular Front program:
    * Drops dogmatic revolutionary Leninist politics, began to form more alliance for better shot at change
    * CP activists enter liberal reformism and anti-fascist groups (labor unions, New Deal admin, etc)
    * CP Popular Front slogan - “Communism is 20th Century Americanism"

Under Popular Front, CP membership triples within a few years (still less than 100,000);

* Who were CP members?
    * Hard‐core revolutionaries and ideological Stalinists
    * People looking for social justice in an era of inequality, depression & mass suffering
    * People looking for a way to fight fascism and anti‐Semitism
    * People looking to fight racism & segregation.
* Many American communists and sympathizers joined the industrial union movement, the New Deal administration, the effort to defeat Nazi Germany;
* After Nazi Germany invades USSR (1941), American Communists are hyper‐patriotic supporters of war effort
* By WWII, many US Communists saw no contradiction b/w loyalty to USA and support for USSR

##### 1946 - Winston Churchill gives “Iron Curtain” speech

* Says the buffer zone the USSR are created between them and Western Germany were horrific areas
* At same time, strong undercurrent of anti-communism - see it as an evil and parasitic way of life infecting way of life endangering Americanism.
* 1946 - GOP gets both houses of Congress
    * Strongly opposed to big gov politics of New Deal
    * Lower taxes, less gov spending on defense and foreign aid (isolationist sentiment, want their life to go back to normal)
    * Truman is unpopular for his international ventures at the time, went against these ideas
* Also fear that bombed/devastated areas of Western Europe would turn to Communism to help them recover.
* Response to this fear of spreading communism was the “Containment Strategy"
    * Soviets were a political threat, so the best way was economic containment by rebuilding Europe + demand in good capitalistic economies to give them basic needs and keep them from “crossing over"
    * Marshall Plan - $13 bil for Euro reconstruction, invested in Western Europe and Western Europe to orient all the areas towards the West (USA).
    * US Secret interventions also hinder W. Euro Communist parties + unions, meddle with them internally
    * Worst nightmare for USSR - rebuilding industrial might of Germany in the center of anti-commie Western Europe
    * US Public and GOP Congress still more isolationist, creates political issues for Truman - how does he get the money?
        * Truman’s answer - heighten public sense of commie threat, rally support for his global anti-commie policies.
        * Also helps him not seem “soft on communism” to Congress
        * Truman orders loyalty oaths to federal employees, and membership/affiliation/sympathies towards commies/fascists/anything subversive. Very vague, intensified fear of communism even more and built red scare momentum
        * Truman covering his ass = greater, intensified red scare that spread to many private companies/businesses as well.

##### Truman’s scare anti-communist rhetoric appealed to:

* Republicans - isolationists and fiscal conservatives, countered because they also hated commies
* Business Interests - used the anti-communist rhetoric to further attack the New Deal and labor movement
* Souther Segregationists - associated civil rights movement with evil commie subversive plans
* Nativist groups - feared “un-American” immigrants bringing ideologies like communism
* Fundamentalist Christians + Catholic Church - hated “godless communism"
* Patriotic Groups - committed to promoting Americanism as defense of freedom
* Labor Unions and liberal groups - wanted to distance themselves from communism to cover their asses as well
    * Why labor unions went through several “purges"

##### 1948 - Tensions rising even further

* Stalin sees Marshall Plan as an attempt to turn Europe against USSR
* Stalin supports commie coup in Czechoslovakia to solidify Soviet Control of Eastern Europe

Turning Point in 1949

1. Communists win in China
    * Communism now more than just the USSR, spreading globally
    * GOP accuses of Truman losing China to commies
2. Soviets detonate an A-bomb, end of US Nuclear monopoly (bad)
    * US Nuke deterrent no longer holds
    * Led to formation of NATO Alliance
    * Red Army in E Europe is MUCH bigger than USA and Western forces, by 500%
3. US Scientists begin pushing for forming a “super” bomb
    * Nuclear fission to thermonuclear fusion
    * Major arms race escalation

##### NSC-68 - defines American Cold War overview

* Rise of a “new kind of adversary” view, pose “deep peril” to USA
* Enemy is fueled by fanatical faith, wants to impose absolute authority over all
    * USSR was slave state
    * Compromise or co-existance was impossible
    * Commies only want total corruption or total destruction of us, one must win while the other loses
* Becomes a zero-sum game struggle - any loss of a free institution is a win for commies
* US strategy become about global military containment
* Communism = antithesis of Americanism, deadly enemies around the world and at home

##### What about North Korea?

* NK invades SK, Stalin eventually agrees to give aid if Chinese support him (they do), NK a satellite
* US decides to intervene militarily, don’t want to be “appeasers” esp. with US credibility at stake (Moscow was using this as a test of US will to fight)
* Heightened fears of commie aggression oversees, and then subversion of US at home

##### Soviet’s Atomic Bomb, and related traitors

* Helped with by Klaus Fuchs and Theodore Hall from US, gave lots of info to the US
* Julius Rosenburg (minor USSR spy), Ethel Rosenburg (not spy)
* Alger Hiss - state dept. official accused of being a spy, convicted of perjury in 1950
* FBI Director planned to suspend Habeas Corpus, wanted mass arrest and “permanent detention” for 12k possible subversives by FBI
    * Often done with illegal means, like warrantless searches, wire-taps, break-ins, false advertising, etc
    * FBI secretly gave info to Congressional Red Hunters/state+local goes/private employers/the milk man on the condition that they didn’t reveal their source.
* Too damn politically dangerous to appear “soft on communism"

##### Criminalizing Domestic Communists

* Smith Act in 1940 - illegal to teach or advocate overthrow of US gov, belong to any org that did so
    * 1949 - 11 leaders of CPUSA put on trial for violating them
    * Membership of CPUSA equated with criminal conspiracy to advocate overthrow of gov
    * SCOTUS upholds the Smith Act in 1951, in 1957 its convictions are overthrown since advocacy of political ideas aren’t themselves criminal acts
* Smith Act contributed to powerful public sentiment that CP membership/assoc/sympathy was part of evil Kremlin conspiracy

##### McCarthysim

Begins in 1950, Sen McCarthy builds up political career through anti-commie hysteria

* No evidence, but claimed names of 100s of commie spies in US govt
* Had been agents in 1930s, few remaining in 1950 (blown cover or withdrawn)
    * Was basically a late-comer to the anti-commie bandwagon
    * Intercepted memo from KGB saying they lacked agents in US, State Dept
* McCarthy identifies no one whose an actual spy, unsurprisingly

##### Brief overview of the Red Scare:

* Major attack on the popular front - liberals got split back off from the radicals
* Destroyed institutional infrastructure of the political left
* Weakened and contained the New Deal (no major reforms after FDR), halted progressive reform in the US

Who were the groups using populist rhetoric to attack liberals, liberal establishment, and progressive movements?

* Anti-commies
* Religious Conservatives
* Patriotic Veterans Groups - attacked “disloyal” scientists, teachers, writers, journalists, etc who all think they “know better than common-sense Americans."
* Conservative Intellectuals - Groups taking control of the government and turning it against the interests of the American citizens.

### Ronald Reagan Market Populism and the New Right

President Nixon:

* Adopted the Goldwater rhetoric that spoke for the silent majority in America (election in 1968)
    * Speak for hard-working taxpayers who don’t whine, he’s the voice of this “real America."

President Reagan:

* After past Republicans started building a new GOP coalition, Reagan is the one that pulled it all together.

##### 1960s and “New Left"

* What were the factors that led to the GOP creating the new coalition?
* Civil Rights movement: desegregation, Civil Rights and Voting Rights Act
* Anti War Movement - rallies millions to oppose Vietnam War, highlight military-industrial complex
* Student movement and counter-culture - celebrates sex, drugs, rock and roll
* Feminist movement - reveals unequal politics of gender, gay rights emerges too
* Environmental movement - against corporate movement

All these were very destabilizing to traditional social hierarchies.

* Nixon and the GOP built on all this to appeal to frustrated white middle-class voters and start building the new coalition
* Led to conservative free-market populism
    * Meaning of Americanism - constitutionally protected individual freedom from govt interference
    * Govt action is ultimately based on force and coercion, inconsistent with US tradition of individual values - must only be done for the essentials
    * Big govt and “intellectual elite” are enemies of ordinary Americans + their freedom
        * Outside of it’s original functions, private sector is always better
        * Welfare hasn’t fixed our problems, but the liberal planners keep planning more (piling on)
        * Each new program is another loss of freedom with more taxes and less choice
    * Americans should resist collectivism/socialism, defending individual freedom and the profit motive - from home and abroad

##### The Ideology of Market Populism

* The people’s freedom is best expressed through the market
    * Choose where to work, what to produce/consume, allocate own resources
    * Income earned through the market is paid through a good or service, reflects social validation and approval - each dollar earned is a vote for that person’s freedom
* Gov is enemy of people’s freedom
    * Fundamentally coercive, limits free choice
    * Uses power to enforce taxation
    * Sidesteps market competition, gov spending allocates resources to inefficient, unvirtuous purposes
    * Even democratic gov is a threat to popular liberty, slippery slope to tyranny.

Reagan blends this Market Populism into the New Right movement

* Business and wealthy interests remain the GOP core
* Increasing appeal to formerly Dem blue-collar voters
    * Mainly white and middle class
    * Producerist populism supports hard workers hurt by social parasites, big gov liberal, welfare parasites, etc
* Moral Majority mobilizes evangelical Christians as new Religious Right
    * Backlash of all new right frustration sources lead to a backlash, saw them all as counter-culture
        * Saw it as an attack on their religious freedoms+ values
    * Blamed on secularism in culture and big gov dominated by liberals
    * Religious right continues to bring grassroots activists to the GOP party.

##### Real Enemies

* "Even paranoids have real enemies."
* Rise of the national security state during and after WWI
    1. Secretive, hiding its actions + motives
    2. Surveillance/repression of dissent
    3. Official propaganda (pro-war, full gov apparatus sent to public sphere)
        * Flipped of this - demonized dissidence/disagreement, they must be core US enemies (within the population)

WWI - saw the incredible potential of trade with China, pushed an “Open Door” note to other countries trading there in 1899. Called for more open doors to free trade in the area, an indirect was of contributing to the imperialism happening there.

During WWII, FDR gave J. Edgar Hoover secret authorization to investigate subversives.

* Fear of subversives into the country in anticipation of, and during, WWII.
* This grew into bigger issues during the Red Scare, mainly in COINTELPRO and the Palmer Raids.
* After not having many chances to do this with Truman, gets approval for it by FDR and creates a massive spying program. Kept very quiet from FDR.
    * Trying to identify and target subversives., illegal surveillance due to citizens’ politics.
    * Warrantless wire-taps.
    * Black bag jobs - broke into offices and looked through stuff
    * The FBI Security Index

##### Roswell New Mexico

* Wreckage is found, government says its a weather balloon
* Really a military vehicle made to sail high over the USSR and collect nuclear info
* Thought the lie was to cover up alien contact

### Conspiracy Culture and the John Birch Society

* Their magazine: New America Magazine
* Conspiracism - Worldview based on “based that powerful, hidden, evil forces control human destinies.
    * Reduces complex historical process to simple, individualistic causes (evildoers)
* Basic elements of a conspiracist worldview
    1. Maintain view of history, a black and white view of good and evil
    2. There are no accidents or coincidences
    3. Nothing is as it really seems, there’s always forces operating behind the scenes. Conspirators hide their tracks with deception
    4. Everything is connected, but these connections are often hidden by conspirators

##### Paradox in conspiracy theory

* If conspiracists are so smart and secretive, how do they know about it?
* Answer is Esoteric knowledge - they can find the traces and clues left behind that can be deciphered and interpreted. They’re smart enough to figure it all out, the other people are sheep
    * An appeal of conspiracists, they offer info that no one else knows.
* Non-falsifiability in it, it can’t be broken with evidence
    * Any kind of counter-evidence is a product of conspirators, so they’ll never believe it.
    * Will be dismissed as disinformation meant to hide the “truth."
* Finding like-minded conspiracy thinkers reinforces initial suspicions, can help reinforce these beliefs and have relatively intelligent people believing in them.

##### Founder of John Birch Society - Robert Welch

* Opponent of New Deal, huge anti-communist, supported McCarthyism
* JBS had official “Americanism” ideology based off free market ideology with producerist populism and hyper-patriotic nativism
    * Markets, producers, and “true Americans"
* Thought leader in right-wing populist conspiracies in USA
* Didn’t see a political spectrum of communist left and fascist right
    * No law was anarchy, any laws from the fed was 100% tyranny
    * Only law must be built entirely on people’s law, no federal law at all. States, county, towns, family, etc. This was the minimum required amount of law that’d be needed for the country to work.
    * Communism and Fascism aren’t that different, both are tyrannies.
* Didn’t like democracy, since they felt letting everyone have a voice would let “un-american” voices steer the country in a way that’d lead to loss of basic liberties.

##### JBS and Communist Conspiracies

* Felt “communist infiltrators” were dragging America down the path to tyranny. Framed it as ongoing, a major battle that would determine our lives and country forever afterwards, final good and evil battle.
* When McCarthy fell, Welch was vexed as to why this happened. Doesn’t know why the GOP would want to censure him as well as the Dems.
    * Thought this could only be if Republicans and Dems were both part of the communist conspiracy. Left and Right were both standing for 100% government control.
        * Called Eisenhower a communist
    * But if both parties are, why was the Cold War ongoing? The Cold War is just a pretense, a charade. But for what purpose?

##### Revilo P. Oliver

* Founding JBS member in 1958
* Anti-semite and Racist
    * New Deal would help inferior black people
    * Denied the holocaust, done by Jews for sympathy and political power
* Introduced the Illuminati conspiracies to Welch and the JBS
* He was expelled from the JBS in 1966 after public anti-semitic statements, would have hurt the image of respectability of it.

### Illuminati Conspiracy

* Enlightenment theory was seen as a threat to monarch powers (why are you in charge and talking to God, etc), so the Illuminati was formed in secret to avoid the pushback from authorities.
* During French Revolution, Euro conservatives looked for conspiracy or secret societies to explain the upheaval.
* John Robison writes “Proofs of a Conspiracy,” claiming repression didn’t stop the Illuminati, but were underground and became even more secret - used disguises and took over French Masonic lodges.
    * From their secret base, supplanted the French Revolution as part of a plan to uproot all religious establishments and overturn all current govs.
    * This even affected the current independence debate in America between Federalists and Dem Reps - the latter were being influenced by French Revolutionaries (Illuminati).
    * Jedidiah Morse, David Tappan, Timothy Dwight, were all spreading ideas of Dem Reps being tools in the Illuminati conspiracy.
* Effects: 1798 Alien and Sedition Acts (by Federalist Congress)
    * Deport suspicious aliens without due process
    * Criminalized criticism of gov
    * Scapegoating and repression
* After Dem Rep Jefferson elected in 1801, Illuminati references dropped but planted the seeds of basic conspiracy culture. Assimilated into future conspiracy theories as news changed.

##### The Illuminati and the Cold War Conspiracy

* JBS still unsure why Dems and Reps are in a duel charade with the Cold War
* Answer: Illuminati conspiracy, whose aim was imposing tyranny on the human race (very close to happening).
    * Marxism and communism were expressions of the basic Illuminati conspiracy. Everything ultimately comes back to this, it is the brain and everything we see are just limbs from it. Illuminati behind both USSR and the USA, to undermine them both and create total tyranny.
    * Communism claims to be a worker’s movement, but is actually an elite scheme to get the masses to subjugate themselves. These elites were called the “INSIDERS,” are hidden hands behind all conflicts, wealthy super-elites (keep taxes on others, not them).
        * Insiders control the financial center to create large conflicts that need money, and they loan that money to the government. Paying for these debts are funded by income taxes on the producers. Uses gov ability to tax to amass their own wealth.

### Fusion Conservatism

* Libertarians, business/religious conservatives, right-wing populists JBS from 1962-65
* 1960s - Conservative fusion around anti-communism, hostility to New Deal, support for Goldwater
    * JBS was also with the Illuminati conspiracies, which also connected to anti-semitism, white supremacy, christian identity, KKK, etc other bad things.
    * National Review wrote the JBS out of the coalition in 1965 for fear of their craziness putting them in too bad a light.
* Acted as a bridge between movement/mainstream conservative and the far right

##### Political Significance

### White Rage - The Extreme Right

* As opposed to the far right - is more extreme, more racial, more difficult to invite to a dinner party, etc.
* Right wing populism rose as a reaction against the New Deal, labor unions, liberal establishment, desegregation and civil rights, etc
* Next to that on the spectrum is the Conspiracist world view, like the JBS

##### Durham’s definition of the Extreme Right

* White Nationalism - The US is a racially defined republic based on white supremacy
* Centrality of racialized politics, different from conservative of far-right conspiracists. These groups don’t add white-supremacy (explicitly) into their goals

##### Politics of Racialized Struggle for Supremacy and Survival

* People have racially determined identities. Race is biologically determined - natural, objective, real, unambigious
* Culture is just a function of biological race
    * “Western Civilization” is identified with a better white race, the supreme human achievement. A unique cultural legacy endangered by inferior races/cultures
* History is a biological-cultural struggle. Survival among the races.
    * Survival of the fittest, there’s no second place here
    * Survival needs racial supremacy
* Preoccupied with reproduction, since it relates to racial impurity
    * Big fear of mixing race
    * Controlling women’s sexuality, who they’re sleeping with since they could be sleeping with people of various races
    * Homophobia - if you’re not making genetically-superior offspring, you’re helping the enemy

### Tea Party and Right-Wing Populism

Context it arose from:

* Demographic revolution changing the face of America
    * Old white men afraid of losing their privileged status
* Election of Obama, first black president
* Financial crisis, gov bailouts of finance and auto, deep and lasting recession for the rest. Main street vs Wall Street (privileged big corporate America)
* All happening in the political culture of powerful right-wing populism. Vocabulary was available to really build on this already.

Conservative political tendencies it builds on:

* Producerist populism of small businesses are being squeezed between big gov and corporate capital. Gov sees corporate as the favorites and don’t care about the people
* Free market fundamentalism of corporate conservatives and libertarians
* Backlash of older white males against America’s racial transformation
* Backlash of religious conservatives who don’t like the public sphere being secularized. Their religious views are under attack and being oppressed.
* Right-wing media mobilizing a conservative insurgency, get them in the streets to take action
* All the above are united against the enemies: big government, liberal establishment, mainstream media, etc
    * But the coalition is uneasy, since there’s internal divisions in several ways
* Multiple movements + interests at local and national levels
* Grassroots activism and corporate money energizing it, mixing together

Contradictions at its heart:

    * Stimulus of large-scale federal spending, cut off the recession
    * Limited relief for “underwater” homeowners who property values had fallen.
    * Wanted to stop more homes from foreclosing, which would drop housing values even farther. Stop them from going for sale at rock-bottom prices.

* Large emphasis on grassroots democracy
* Rebellion is a universal human response to any kind of domination or repression. No one can be told who can be a “genuine revolutionary.” Rebellious impulses can’t be stifled based on being a member of the working class. Can’t just transition state power to the workers, since state power is inherently dominating - government isn’t free even in hands of communists (Bakunin ideas).
* Propaganda of the Deed - selectively target influential societal figures, show the masses they’re not invulnerable and the system can be challenged.
* Became massively discredited and repressed in the US starting from the 1920s. It remained part of US radical tradition, internal disagreements about revolutionary politics and use of violence.

##### OWS Notes

* Tend to be highly educated adults overrepresented in the supporters. Many had affluent backgrounds. Elite protesting the elite in a sense.
    * Very populist themes, anger with inequality, big money in politics, corporate greed against labor
* Less diverse ethnically, mainly white
* Had life circumstances that gave them time and resources to protests. Fewer family + work commitments, un-or-underemployed millennials with lots of student debt.
* Most are skeptical of mainstream politics for change, but are still politically active. Saw themselves part of a global protest movement for grassroots democracy, anti-austerity protests.
* Were consistently non-violent, police brutality pics used to evoke sympathy
* Political view as a kind of horizontalism - no leaders, hierarchy, official organization, or consistent message
    * Decision-making done by equal consensus
    * Used spokes councils to manage difference groups and bring them together (Anarchistic Principle of Mutual Aid). Each one addressed various needs, like food, finance, etc.
* No single set of demands possibly because it would then alienate people who don’t share these same demands. Aimed for lots of co-existence, not hierarchy of importance of emphasizing some demands over others.
* Contemporary anarchists would argue in favor of the movement saying the goal is to create a common struggle and new system of organizing. Not just achieve a set list of demands.
