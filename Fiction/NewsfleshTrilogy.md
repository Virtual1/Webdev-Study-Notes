### Fear and Control

Themes of fear and how it costs you control? Yet it's like gravity in our minds, and always takes a conscious effort to keep it from controlling us. Especially since people constantly try to take that control from us.

> There will always be people for whom hate is easier when it’s not backed up by anything but fear. And I will always do my best to hoist them by their own petards. (Feed, 134)

> There comes a point when you need to get over the fear and get on with your life, and a lot of people don’t seem to be capable of that anymore. (Feed, 186)

> Stop trying to make people even more afraid than they already are by implying that, somehow, this is just a taste of the torments to come. I’m tired of it, and if there’s a God, I bet He’s tired of it, too. (Feed, 143)

> The trouble with the news is simple: People, especially ones on the ends of the power spectrum, like it when you’re afraid. (Feed, 346)

> This constant ‘stay inside and let yourself be protected’ mentality has gotten more people killed than all the accidental exposures in the world. It’s like we’re all addicted to being afraid.” (Deadline, 182)

> To tell the truth is to provide armament against a world too full of cruelties to be defeated with simple falsehoods. (Deadline, 243)

> That’s the trouble with being scared all the time. Eventually, people just go numb. (Deadline, 335)

> It’s amazing how effective simple disorientation is as a mechanism for controlling people. (Blackout, 39)

> The problem with people who have power is that they start thinking more about what it takes to keep that power than they do about what’s right or wrong or just plain a bad idea. (Blackout, 562)

### Truth

The truth hurts, and is tough. But it's ultimately always better than a lie.

> The difference between the truth and a lie is that both of them can hurt, but only one will take the time to heal you afterward. (Feed, 248)

> ...the only way things could’ve gotten as bad as they did was if people were willing to take the first easy answer they could find and cling to it, rather than doing anything as complicated as actually thinking. (Feed, 277)

> If we didn’t have to fear the truths we didn’t hear, we’d lose the need to fear the ones we did. People should consider that. (Feed, 346)

Less awkward translation: Fear the truths you don't know as much as the ones you do know. Since the damage of not knowing them should inspire just as much fear, if not more.

> A lie, however well-intended, can’t prepare you for reality or change the world. (Deadline, 243)

> Sometimes the hardest thing about the truth is putting down the misassumptions, falsehoods, and half-truths that stand between it and you. Sometimes that’s the last thing that anybody wants to do. And sometimes, it’s the only thing we can do. (Blackout, 51)

> One man’s gospel truth is another man’s blasphemous lie. The dangerous thing about people is the way we’ll try to kill anyone whose truth doesn’t agree with ours. (Blackout, 394)

> ...a truth you don’t understand is more dangerous than a lie. (Blackout, 544)


### Ideas of Normalcy?

The illusion of normalcy? Clinging to an idea of what "normal" should ultimately keeps us from living life in the now.

It's a definition that changes constantly through time, but humans have a hard time changing their own definitions along with it.

> There is a time when even reasonable men must begin to take unreasonable actions. To do anything else is to be less than human. (Deadline, 292)

> “We’re all hauntings waiting to happen, Shaun. The sooner you realize that, the sooner you’ll get past wondering when our normal lives will be starting up again.” (Deadline, 377)

> Right now, I think being crazy may be the only thing that’s keeping me sane. (Deadline, 460)
